Some name changes get skipped, as they can't be auto-approved by our system and require manual approval.

If yours hasn't been auto-approved, please tell us the name change ID and we will manually review it for you.

Note: If you'd like to know why your name change has been skipped, you can visit our website at https://wiseoldman.net/names and hover your cursor over your name change's :information_source: icon.
