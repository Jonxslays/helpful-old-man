Some name changes get denied automatically for things like negative xp gains.

If you'd like to know why your name change was denied, you can visit our website at https://wiseoldman.net/names and hover your cursor over your name change's :information_source: icon.

If you still have questions, please tell us the name change ID and we will manually review it with you.
