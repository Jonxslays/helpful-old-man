To verify your group please provide a screenshot to prove ownership. We have attached an example screenshot showing what we need to see below.

**Screenshot requirements**

- Your Wise Old Man group ID (found in the header of your group page)
- Your discord username or ID
- Todays date

All of these should be typed into the OSRS in-game chat box.

- Your clan tab open showing your username and rank.

For clans you must be `Owner` or `Deputy Owner`. For the old clan chat, you must be `Owner` or `General`. For group ironman groups, you must be `Owner`.
